  "STR" on Wikipedia can refer to Indian actor Silambarasan Thesingu Rajendar (Simbu), the physics theory String Theory, genetic markers called Short Tandem Repeats, medical training roles like Specialty Registrar, or even concepts like Short-Term Rentals and software string functions (like {{str number}}). The context usually determines the meaning, but Simbu (actor) and String Theory (physics) are common uses for the initials.
